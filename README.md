# Inventory Management

## Overview

**Inventory Management** is a cross-platform project originally developed as a mobile application in **CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming**, and later expanded to include a full-stack web solution. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient, user-friendly inventory tracking system for environments like warehouses and retail spaces, with a focus on real-time visibility, security, and scalability.

## üì± Original Artifact: Mobile App (Android)

The initial version of the project is located in:  
`Inventory_Management/Inventory Tracker - Original Artifact/`

This mobile app was designed to:
- Track inventory in real-time
- Display items in a grid format
- Allow users to add, remove, and adjust quantities of items
- Alert users when an item count reaches zero
- Use local storage with SQLite to store login credentials and inventory data
- Feature basic user authentication

## üöÄ Enhanced Artifacts

Over time, the project evolved significantly to demonstrate growth in three major areas:

### üîß Software Design and Engineering
- Migrated core functionality of the mobile app to a **MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)** website  
- Created a modern, responsive UI for the web version  
- Enabled seamless interaction across devices

### üß† Algorithms and Data Structures
- Refactored and optimized the Android app to prepare for integration with the website backend  
- Introduced advanced data handling, client-server communication, and synchronization logic

### üóÑÔ∏è Databases
- Integrated a **shared MongoDB database** for both the web and mobile apps  
- Implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- Enhanced password security by migrating from basic hash storage to **bcrypt** encryption  
- Added **search functionality and pagination** to improve data access and performance  
- Enabled the mobile app to interact with the web APIs for unified data access

### üìÅ Enhanced Artifact Structure
- Located in: `Inventory_Management/Inventory Tracker - Android App/`
- Located in: `Inventory_Management/Inventory Tracker - Website/`
- Located in: `Inventory_Management/Inventory Tracker - MongoDB/`
